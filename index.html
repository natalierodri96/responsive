            <p class="lead">My name is Natalie Marie Rodriguez. I am a 23 year old student, soon to be 24 who refuses to stop learning.
            </p>
              
            <p>I graduated highschool in
          2014. I've done multiple trades including baking and pastry. I am currently employed in the beauty industry as an essential worker. 
          I am now looking for a career change. I have certifications for massage therapy as well as esthetics. I've been at my current job for almost 4 years
            now and have loved every moment. Of course with the current COVID-19 outbreak has certainly made my current position much more difficult
            being an essential worker and putting myself as well as my family at risk.
            </p>
            <p>I currently live in San Antonio, Texas. I have my wonderful 15 year-old chihuahua Freddy and my mischievious 2 year-old cat Yuri. The two of them
            are best buddies with Freddy raising Yuri from a young age. They certainly have their differences but I know they adore eachother.
            I have my mother and father, Barbara and Lorenzo, my awesome step-dad Mark, and my two younger brothers Nickki and Chris. 
            All have supported me all throughout my education journey in more ways than one. They are all very excited to see what I can learn 
            from coding bootcamp and so am I.
            </p>
          <p>
            As a teen I was always enrolled into magnet schools. My first introduction to
            coding was in the seventh grade. I went to Krueger Middle School within 
            the iMAK program. The program focused on computer science and technologies.
            We dived into coding with html, css, javascript, cade. We played with animation, sandbox
            and multiple other programs. From there I enrolled into Roosevelt High School for my
            freshman year. I was in the ETA program which focused on engineering.
            Unfortunately I was unable to continue my education due to my family moving around.
            I always hoped one day to dive back in and really build up my skills and I hope to
            accomplish that with this coding bootcamp.
